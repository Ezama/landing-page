# landing-page

a simple web page showcasing my recently acquired flexbox skills. the page includes a few css styles e.g. background-color, padding e.t.c to add a bit of design to the html
the body of the page acts as a flex container with flex-direction: column; and separate sections are displayed as flex containers as well with the default flex direction.
